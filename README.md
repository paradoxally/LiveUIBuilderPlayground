# LiveUIBuilderPlayground
A delightful way to build your code-based UIKit/SwiftUI views in isolation with live previews!  ðŸŽ‰

**Requires macOS 10.15 Catalina for live previews.**

If your answer is yes to at least one of the following questions, this project is for you.

- Do you need to test a new design in your app but don't want to deal with compiling your entire project?
- Do you need to just focus on the UI for quick prototyping?
- Do you prefer writing layouts in code?

# Usage

Clone the project and open the file you need for UIKit or SwiftUI (either ViewController or ContentView, respectively).

As you type, live previews update in the canvas. 

**Tip: press cmd + option + P to quickly resume previews. You'll find yourself using this a lot!**

Future improvements:

- [ ] Integrate a package manager to easily add required dependencies for testing.
- [ ] Standardize protocols for code clarity and separation of concerns.
